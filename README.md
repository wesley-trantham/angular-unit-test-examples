# AngularUnitTestExamples

This project is intended to contain a comprehensive list of how to approach unit tests in Angular.

Attempts will be made to include additional documentation of structure and method use

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Since the intent for this app is to display spec file use, serving the app will be a secondary priority

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

E2E is currently outside of the scope of this project. Perhaps a later version will address this.

## Further help

Feel free to use the Issues board if you need additional explanations or have additional examples you would like covered
